## General Introduction

(States your motivation clearly: why is it important / interesting to solve this problem?)
(Add real-world examples, if any)
(Put the problem into a historical context, from what does it originate? Are there already some proposed solutions?)

Blake’s Motivation: My research interests and experience are in human-robot interaction (HRI), specifically, situation awareness (SA), trust and reliability, and usability related to automation technology. Most of my work contributes to the Robotics Collaborative Technology Alliance (RCTA) program, which the Army Research LAB (ARL) at UCF/IST are also involved with. As a result, my research experience are focused on automation technology, specifically, what is the relationship between humans and robots and how can we improve the communication interactions seen in human-robot teams. Previous research regarding trust and reliance in human-robot teams suggest that when reliability falls below 70% reliability, automation is considered not useful, and will harm overall task performance. However, if the human teammate cannot perform a task unaided, or if the environment/situation is too risky for a human to begin with, there may still be an advantage or willingness to trust or rely on automation even if automation falls below the threshold (Maltz & Shinar, 2003). In the military domain, there is an increasing number of humans who are or will be performing tasks with the help of automation (Parasuraman & Wickens, 2008). In real world applications, information acquisition and analysis are rarely perfect, whether performed by humans or automation (St. John & Manes, 2002). Even when automation is imperfect, in most scenarios automation improves system performance (Yeh, Merlo, Wickens, & Brandenburg, 2003). Previous research states that when automation reliability levels fall below 70% (e.g., Madhavan, Wiegamann, & Lacson, 2006), performance tends to decrease levels lower than those of manual task performance alone (i.e., without assistance from automation). Wickens and Dixon (2007) identified the 70% reliability threshold, which is based on a review of studies in which the automation performed tasks which human could also perform unaided. In these types of scenarios, if reliability falls too low, automation may be perceived as useless, or even as being detrimental to overall task performance. As a result, making the human operators less likely to rely on automated systems, and instead, tasks will be executed manually without assistance from automation. 

Justin’s Motivation: I am motivated to observe the cost effectiveness and efficiency of drones when deployed in air combat scenarios. When the cost of some of the latest Department of Defense (DoD) combat aircraft is soaring upwards of 100 Million dollars, finding alternate means of air defense is an area of focus to be considered moving forward. I am interested in analyzing performance of one F-35 stealth fighter in a combat situation, vs 10 combat drones in the same scenario. I would like to answer the questions, “Which approach is more economical?”, and  “Which approach will be more effective in reaching the objective?”. 

Ugur’s Motivation: Armed forces use technology to gain superiority on the battlefield. Recent breakthroughs in the field of Artificial Intelligence and Unmanned Systems provide new uses for military operations. In my the research project HUMAN-ASSISTED WEAPON SYSTEMS I compared the semi-autonomous operation with the supervised-autonomous operation of drones. I think that on the battlefield of the future, those who use fully autonomous systems will be successful. In this project, I would like to improve the effectiveness of drones by implementing AI techniques such as Reinforcement Learning to operate those fully autonomous.


(You should begin by introducing your topic. In this section, you should define the core terminology specific to the field, introduce the problem statement, and make clear the benefits (motivate!) of resolving that problem statement. The main difference between the ABSTRACT and Introduction sections is that the abstract summarizes the entire project, including results, whereas the introduc-tion only provides the motivation of the problem and an overview of the proposed solution.)

(I tell students to answer the questions, one paragaph each to start if you are lost)

(Problem Statement. One paragraph to describe the prob-lem that you are tackling.)

(Motivation. Why is this problem interesting and relevant to the research community?)

(Proposed Solution. How do we propose to tackle this problem (that has been identified in the previous para-graphs, is interesting to the community, and has yet to be tackled by other researchers)?)

(Contributions. An enumeration of the contributions of the senior design project)

(This project makes the following contributions:)(you must have this!!)
- We believe our project will contribute to advancing the study of human-robot interaction (HRI).
- We believe our project will contribute to the area of research on trust and reliability in automation technology.
- We believe the implementation of stimulated autonomous air fighters in ArmA 3 will provide insight on the real world application of autonomous drones. 


## The Model

(Provide structural and behavior diagrams of the system you wish to study.) (Why is your model a good abtraction of the problem you want to study?) (Are you capturing all the relevant aspects of the problem?) (Use the model to tell us what is going on.)

(explicitly list your requirements of what the model will have and simulate for the proposal)

## Fundamental Questions
(At the end of the project you want to find the answer to these questions) (Formulate a few, clear questions. Articulate them in sub-questions, from the more general to the more specific.)

1. What is the relationship between humans and robots?
2. Which condition (i.e., human-in-the-loop, human-on-the-loop, human-out-of-the-loop generates higher reliability? 
3. Based on the reliability results, do the results have an impact on trust?



## Expected Results
(What are the answers to the above questions that you expect to find before starting your research?) (This changes from Expected (Proposal) to just Results (final report)) (you should verbally define them) (sketch a few graphs of what you are roughly going for - not the data but histogram of this, line graph of that, screenshot of an agent - use paper and pencil sketches)

## Research Methods
(Cellular Automata, Agent-Based Model, Discrete Event Continuous Modeling...)(Python or Anylogic) (If you are not sure here: 1. Consult your colleagues, 2. ask the teachers, 3. remember that you can change it afterwards) (Steps in the process)

## (Other)
(change the title and amount of headers as needed) (mention datasets you are going to use) (mention base code or examples you)

## Discussion
(final only - remove whole section for proposal Readme) (What would you have done differently) (What are the contributions summerize)(what is the big take away)(what did you learn)

## Future Work
(final only - remove whole section for proposal Readme) (if you had 6 more months what would be the next steps in this project.) (What are a few questions you have now)

If given six more months to work on our final project, we would like to focus our future efforts toward implementing our work into Unreal engine/Unity. If we were to implement our work into Unreal engine we would be able to further investigate and validate the results we found in ArmA 3. Implementing our work into Unreal engine/Unity would provide us with the means to compare our results to determine if our results are generalizable, significant, or even worth further exploring in future works.

Furthermore, we would like to try and improve our study design by incorporating human-subjects into our study to potentially investigate whether or not humans would or would not trust and rely on unmanned aerial drones. It would also be interesting to look at the preferences between the specific level of automation that is preferred for unmanned aerial drones. For example, depending on the level of expertise, that can also affect the level of trust and reliability in automation. A person will background experience with automation may view higher levels of automation to be trustworthy and reliable versus a novice user that may not have experience with automation. Thus, from a novice perspective, they may view lower levels of automation, therefore, believe automation is not trustworthy or unreliable.
